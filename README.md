# TikTok Data Analysis Project – Travel/Visa Niche

This repository contains my project for the **Data Analytics for AI Applications** course at TU Chemnitz.

The goal of the project is to analyze my own TikTok videos in the **travel and visa** niche and find out what factors
influence engagement and reach (views, likes, comments, shares, saves).

---

## Project Overview

I use real data from my TikTok creator account.  
Each row in the dataset represents one video and includes information such as:

- Topic (visa, travel, scholarship, job, etc.)
- Hook style (question, FOMO, story…)
- Video format (talking head, slideshow, green screen…)
- Posting date and time
- Duration (seconds)
- Views, likes, comments, shares, saves
- Profile visits, followers gained
- Basic watch-time metrics (if available)

The project follows the structure of a **Data Analytics / Explainer Project**:

1. Dataset selection and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
4. Simple ML model to predict high-performing videos  
5. Visualizations and interpretation of results
